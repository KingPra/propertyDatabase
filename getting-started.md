       
        Commercial and residential property change hands on a daily basis in Harnett County with daily updates occurring to the
Harnett County Property Data Base.
More often than not the change of ownership of property goes unnoticed by the Harnett county economic staff until such time as development actually begins by the new owner.  Since it is the role of economic development to facilitate and enhance commercial and residential growth throughout the county it would be beneficial for all economic entities throughout the county to be informed as soon as property changes hands .

The project: 
Connect with the Harnett County database and produce a list of all properties that changed hands on a daily/weekly/monthly basis.
